Welcome to the website code for our Event Planner Program: Meetitude!

This website allows users to create an event, send out a unique link to others for the event, and
let's them fill out their schedules in order to generate possible meeting times.

Our frontend is html, css
Our backend is in javascript

We plan on running this server either on github directly or AWS, stay tuned!
